# Tic Tac Toe (React Tutorial)
This the tutorial for React which can be found here:

## Changes from the Tutorial
* I made a slight change to make the X's red and the O's blue.

## Getting Started
1. Clone the git repo `git clone https://github.com/jlheard/tic-tac-toe-react.git`
2. Navigate to the project home `cd tic-tac-toe-react`
3. Install the Node package `npm install`
4. Run the Node server `npm start`
5. Navigate to http://localhost:3000/
6. Click on any square to start the game.

## TODO
* Add a tie conditon that shows when the came is tied/cat.
* Do I include the package JSON files into source control?
